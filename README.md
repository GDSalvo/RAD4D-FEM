# Largest Header RAD4D-FEM
RAD4D-FEM is a MATLAB code that generates COMSOL Multiphysics files ready to be expanded into four-dimensional (4D) chemical, physical, and geometrical scenarios. This tool streamlines the process of setting up complex simulations that involve both spatial and temporal dimensions, enabling researchers and engineers to focus on analysis rather than model setup.

### Medium Header Introduction
Modeling and simulating processes that evolve over time and space can be challenging. RAD4D-FEM simplifies this by providing MATLAB scripts that automate the creation of COMSOL models, ready for 4D analysis. Whether you're dealing with time-dependent chemical reactions, physical phenomena, or evolving geometries, this tool can help you set up your simulations efficiently.

### Medium Header Features
Automated COMSOL File Generation: Create ready-to-run COMSOL models using MATLAB.
4D Simulation Ready: Set up models that incorporate  as the fourth dimension.
Complex Geometries: Define and manipulate geometries that change over time.
Chemical and Physical Processes: Integrate chemical kinetics and physical laws into your models.
User-Friendly Scripts: Well-documented MATLAB code that's easy to customize.
Prerequisites
MATLAB: Version R2019b or later.
COMSOL Multiphysics: Version 5.6 or later with LiveLink for MATLAB.
Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Optional: Familiarity with MATLAB scripting and COMSOL modeling.
Installation
Clone or Download the Repository:

### Medium Header bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAD4D-FEM.git
Add to MATLAB Path:

Open MATLAB.

Navigate to the RAD4D-FEM directory.

Add the directory to your MATLAB path:

matlab
Copiar código
addpath(genpath('path_to_RAD4D-FEM'));
savepath;
Verify COMSOL and MATLAB Integration:

Ensure that COMSOL with LiveLink for MATLAB is properly installed and licensed.
Test the connection by running a simple COMSOL model from MATLAB.
Usage
Configure Your Model:

Open the main MATLAB script RAD4D_main.m.
Customize the parameters, geometry, and physical properties as needed.
Run the MATLAB Script:

Execute the script in MATLAB:

matlab
Copiar código
run('RAD4D_main.m');
This will generate a COMSOL .mph file with your specified settings.

Open in COMSOL:

Launch COMSOL Multiphysics.
Open the generated .mph file.
Set up any additional studies or solvers if necessary.
Run the simulation and analyze the results.
